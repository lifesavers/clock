(This requires substantial further work. Recovery⁵ time needed after writing the [lifesaver labs, Pax-mod Calendar][calendar] out. This is still in scrap ⇌ draft state. i will write just what's necessary for a computer scientist, temporal culture social psychologist, graphic or software designer, or policy-maker to catch my drift.)

W = Wake
L = Lunch
S = Steep



2L = (-2) + 12 = 1000
L4 = 12 + 4 = 1600

So..

W2 = 0800
W2:18 = 0818

1S = 9PM or 2100.


Let's say it's 6 PM Current Local. You'd see L6 on Your clockface, but then the clock will elegantly⁵ turn over at the transition from L6:58 to L6:59 to 3:XXS, often with a visual, auditory, or vibratory alert to let You know that wei're now in the Steep Countdown Zone, then continue the countdown to S (2S, 1S, :54S, :36S, :18S, :10S, :02S, S). Your Clockface is now really intelligent to Your Steep Plan, and You can of course shift its phase, if You want to or need to. 


WLS System operates on prefix and postfix notations. 

The S for "Steep" implies, "Sleep Steeply, Steep with Tea [Unwind, Cooldown, Get ready for bed] in the Hour Countdown Before" 




Doing so eternally⁵ would be easiest if Wei could all shift to Orient.ed⁺ Skype 上海 Shanghai Time for an All-World Universal Time that any Time Zone Jump in any direction reverts to as an "All World Collaborative Planning Zone". Meaning, when Colorado talks to New York or Texas talks to California, Wei do it in Orient.ed⁺ Time-Zone Ranges, and not trying to adapt to each Local Time Zone one at a time.  Orient.ed⁺ is the Time Zone 

Not as much as the Calendar, but to Get Really Well Coordinated, Wei need to at minimum support a Prime, All-World Universal Time 

Local Lunch and Steep Time.

Since We're speaking of the Calendar, and getting into the nitty-gritty of the Long-term Code Changes needed to get this to Work, wei should also talk about how to make Local Time Better, and Drop Railway Local Time and its constant interference with Global Orient.ed Time, or what might also be known as Skype 上海 Shanghai Time. 

Wei have cellphones and laptops and computers today.  Wei don't have to be tied down to the metapour of a "constant rotational velocity⁵" mechanical clock face. It's objectively not healthy.. the American Academy of Pediatrics published a report that indicates schools should never start before 8:30 AM or students will die in traffic crashes and arrive at school too fatigued to learn.  

Now, the question is, Y⁵? Let me skip a few steps, and take You to the root of it. Midnight is used as the naive "Steep Now!" cue, and a large number of students in high school won't steep until the clock turns from 11:59 PM to 12:00 AM (the PM to AM shift is enuf to trigger a decisional shift and send a student who's staying up late doing homework or, more likely in the present day⁵ U|S⁺ ATUS Studies, watching television, playing a video game, or browsing a social network, to bed). Students need a visual indicator that "Now's the Time to Steep." Students aren't the only ones who need the indicator.. i could use such an indicator myself, too.

But there's No Agreed Upon Convention for Anatomic Landmarks thru the Day in Local Time.
